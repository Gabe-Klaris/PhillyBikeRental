"# PhillyBikeRental" 
Git Repo for Gabe junior project 2021:
Main program is Mapplottingfinal.py, all other files are parts of the main program and testing files.
Requires packages streamlit, urllib, pandas, pydeck, matplotlib, numpy, datetime, plotly and holidays.
The project uses streamlit for display, to run the program using streamlit use "streamlit run *filename*" in terminal.
The program pulls data from indego bike stations, the used CSV files are found in the repo, and all of the files can be found here: https://www.rideindego.com/about/data/
The program also pulls data from this website: https://kiosks.bicycletransit.workers.dev/phl

As a side note, after each quarter indego will publish a new dataset with the quarter data once the data comes out, however the program will continue to show from the first quarter.
Also after the year ends, the algorithm for getting the past date in 2020 and 2019 will become outdated
but it shouldn't crash (I think).
Update: The program crashes because the website used does not include one of the stations listed. Yes, it's stupid, no I don't feel like fixing it. 
**I will not be updating the code.**<br />

Hey guys so funny story, I updated the code!<br />
It is now in a new repository at https://github.com/Tubby101/Mapplotting. <br />
The new repository has the same function and is the same thing.
